 \#\# Introduction

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: Quoted sections like this will provide helpful
instructions on how to navigate and use a Jupyter notebook.
\end{quote}

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in
number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing
systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30
minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is
easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to
unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of
data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are
used.

In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data
provided by \href{https://www.motivateco.com/}{Motivate}, a bike-share
system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will
compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City,
Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any
differences within each system for those users that are registered,
regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

     \#\# Posing Questions

Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking
questions you might want to understand about the bike share data.
Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of
information would you want to know about in order to make smarter
business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what
factors might influence how you would want to use the service?

\textbf{Question 1}: Write at least two questions related to bike
sharing that you think could be answered by data.

\textbf{Answer}: 1. I would like to know the usage, average spending of
customer in all three cities New York, Chicago and Washington DC so that
promotion by the marketing team can be done where use of bike sharing is
less.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Analysing the behaviour of the customer if they are comfortable with
  yearly subscription or daily pass and frequency of using bikes.
\end{enumerate}

     \#\# Data Collection and Wrangling

Now it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, we will
focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected
cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities
has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  New York City (Citi Bike):
  \href{https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data}{Link}
\item
  Chicago (Divvy): \href{https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data}{Link}
\item
  Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare):
  \href{https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data}{Link}
\end{itemize}

If you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different
way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year,
Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly.
\textbf{However, you do not need to download the data yourself.} The
data has already been collected for you in the \texttt{/data/} folder of
the project files. While the original data for 2016 is spread among
multiple files for each city, the files in the \texttt{/data/} folder
collect all of the trip data for the year into one file per city. Some
data wrangling of inconsistencies in timestamp format within each city
has already been performed for you. In addition, a random 2\% sample of
the original data is taken to make the exploration more manageable.

\textbf{Question 2}: However, there is still a lot of data for us to
investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry
from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell
below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your
analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first
trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data
file).

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: You can run a code cell like you formatted Markdown cells
above by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut
\textbf{Shift} + \textbf{Enter} or \textbf{Shift} + \textbf{Return}.
Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the \textbf{Play}
button in the toolbar after selecting it. While the cell is running, you

    If everything has been filled out correctly, you should see below the
printout of each city name (which has been parsed from the data file
name) that the first trip has been parsed in the form of a dictionary.
When you set up a \texttt{DictReader} object, the first row of the data
file is normally interpreted as column names. Every other row in the
data file will use those column names as keys, as a dictionary is
generated for each row.

This will be useful since we can refer to quantities by an
easily-understandable label instead of just a numeric index. For
example, if we have a trip stored in the variable \texttt{row}, then we
would rather get the trip duration from
\texttt{row{[}\textquotesingle{}duration\textquotesingle{}{]}} instead
of \texttt{row{[}0{]}}.

 \#\#\# Condensing the Trip Data

It should also be observable from the above printout that each city
provides different information. Even where the information is the same,
the column names and formats are sometimes different. To make things as
simple as possible when we get to the actual exploration, we should trim
and clean the data. Cleaning the data makes sure that the data formats
across the cities are consistent, while trimming focuses only on the
parts of the data we are most interested in to make the exploration
easier to work with.

You will generate new data files with five values of interest for each
trip: trip duration, starting month, starting hour, day of the week, and
user type. Each of these may require additional wrangling depending on
the city:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Duration}: This has been given to us in seconds (New York,
  Chicago) or milliseconds (Washington). A more natural unit of analysis
  will be if all the trip durations are given in terms of minutes.
\item
  \textbf{Month}, \textbf{Hour}, \textbf{Day of Week}: Ridership volume
  is likely to change based on the season, time of day, and whether it
  is a weekday or weekend. Use the start time of the trip to obtain
  these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their
  timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The
  \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html}{\texttt{datetime}}
  package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.
\item
  \textbf{User Type}: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a
  bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to
  users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users
  into two types: `Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other
  longer-term subscriptions, and `Casual', for users with 24-hour,
  3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses
  `Subscriber' and `Customer' for these groups, respectively. For
  consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other
  two.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question 3a}: Complete the helper functions in the code cells
below to address each of the cleaning tasks described above.

\textbf{Tip}: If you save a jupyter Notebook, the output from running
code blocks will also be saved. However, the state of your workspace
will be reset once a new session is started. Make sure that you run all
of the necessary code blocks from your previous session to reestablish
variables and functions before picking up where you last left off.

 \#\# Exploratory Data Analysis

Now that you have the data collected and wrangled, you're ready to start
exploring the data. In this section you will write some code to compute
descriptive statistics from the data. You will also be introduced to the
\texttt{matplotlib} library to create some basic histograms of the data.

 \#\#\# Statistics

First, let's compute some basic counts. The first cell below contains a
function that uses the csv module to iterate through a provided data
file, returning the number of trips made by subscribers and customers.
The second cell runs this function on the example Bay Area data in the
\texttt{/examples/} folder. Modify the cells to answer the question
below.

\textbf{Question 4a}: Which city has the highest number of trips? Which
city has the highest proportion of trips made by subscribers? Which city
has the highest proportion of trips made by short-term customers?

\textbf{Answer}: New York has the highest number of trips.New York has
the highest propotion of trips made by subscribers. Chicago has the
highest propotion of trips made by short-term customers.

\textbf{Tip}: In order to add additional cells to a notebook, you can
use the ``Insert Cell Above'' and ``Insert Cell Below'' options from the
menu bar above. There is also an icon in the toolbar for adding new
cells, with additional icons for moving the cells up and down the
document. By default, new cells are of the code type; you can also
specify the cell type (e.g.~Code or Markdown) of selected cells from the
Cell menu or the dropdown in the toolbar.

Now, you will write your own code to continue investigating properties
of the data.

\textbf{Question 4b}: Bike-share systems are designed for riders to take
short trips. Most of the time, users are allowed to take trips of 30
minutes or less with no additional charges, with overage charges made
for trips of longer than that duration. What is the average trip length
for each city? What proportion of rides made in each city are longer
than 30 minutes?

\textbf{Answer}: The average travel time for New York is 15.81, Chicago
16.56 and Washington 18.93. Percentage of trips longer than 30 mins in
New York is 7.3\%, Chicago 8.3\% and Washington 10.8\%.

    \textbf{Question 4c}: Dig deeper into the question of trip duration
based on ridership. Choose one city. Within that city, which type of
user takes longer rides on average: Subscribers or Customers?

\textbf{Answer}: I used Chicago csv and in Chicago customers takes
longer ride i.e 30 minutes.

     \#\#\# Visualizations

The last set of values that you computed should have pulled up an
interesting result. While the mean trip time for Subscribers is well
under 30 minutes, the mean trip time for Customers is actually
\emph{above} 30 minutes! It will be interesting for us to look at how
the trip times are distributed. In order to do this, a new library will
be introduced here, \texttt{matplotlib}. Run the cell below to load the
library and to generate an example plot.

    In the above cell, we collected fifty trip times in a list, and passed
this list as the first argument to the \texttt{.hist()} function. This
function performs the computations and creates plotting objects for
generating a histogram, but the plot is actually not rendered until the
\texttt{.show()} function is executed. The \texttt{.title()} and
\texttt{.xlabel()} functions provide some labeling for plot context.

You will now use these functions to create a histogram of the trip times
for the city you selected in question 4c. Don't separate the Subscribers
and Customers for now: just collect all of the trip times and plot them.

    If you followed the use of the \texttt{.hist()} and \texttt{.show()}
functions exactly like in the example, you're probably looking at a plot
that's completely unexpected. The plot consists of one extremely tall
bar on the left, maybe a very short second bar, and a whole lot of empty
space in the center and right. Take a look at the duration values on the
x-axis. This suggests that there are some highly infrequent outliers in
the data. Instead of reprocessing the data, you will use additional
parameters with the \texttt{.hist()} function to limit the range of data
that is plotted. Documentation for the function can be found
\href{https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html\#matplotlib.pyplot.hist}{{[}here{]}}.

\textbf{Question 5}: Use the parameters of the \texttt{.hist()} function
to plot the distribution of trip times for the Subscribers in your
selected city. Do the same thing for only the Customers. Add limits to
the plots so that only trips of duration less than 75 minutes are
plotted. As a bonus, set the plots up so that bars are in five-minute
wide intervals. For each group, where is the peak of each distribution?
How would you describe the shape of each distribution?

\textbf{Answer}: I used Chicago database for this and peak for Customers
and Subscribers is between 5-10

     \#\# Performing Your Own Analysis

So far, you've performed an initial exploration into the data available.
You have compared the relative volume of trips made between three U.S.
cities and the ratio of trips made by Subscribers and Customers. For one
of these cities, you have investigated differences between Subscribers
and Customers in terms of how long a typical trip lasts. Now it is your
turn to continue the exploration in a direction that you choose. Here
are a few suggestions for questions to explore:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has
  the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer
  trips change depending on the month or season?
\item
  Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays?
  On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about
  Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the
  day of the week?
\item
  During what time of day is the system used the most? Is there a
  difference in usage patterns for Subscribers and Customers?
\end{itemize}

If any of the questions you posed in your answer to question 1 align
with the bullet points above, this is a good opportunity to investigate
one of them. As part of your investigation, you will need to create a
visualization. If you want to create something other than a histogram,
then you might want to consult the
\href{https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/pyplot_summary.html}{Pyplot
documentation}. In particular, if you are plotting values across a
categorical variable (e.g.~city, user type), a bar chart will be useful.
The
\href{https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html\#matplotlib.pyplot.bar}{documentation
page for \texttt{.bar()}} includes links at the bottom of the page with
examples for you to build off of for your own use.

\textbf{Question 6}: Continue the investigation by exploring another
question that could be answered by the data available. Document the
question you want to explore below. Your investigation should involve at
least two variables and should compare at least two groups. You should
also use at least one visualization as part of your explorations.

\textbf{Answer}: I analysed the New York database using usertype (i.e
Customers and Subscribers) and hours. Below is the histogram that shows
usage pattern for Customers and Subscribers in New York. Subscribers
most popular time = 17-18 Customers most polpular time = 15-16

     \#\# Conclusions

Congratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of
the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the
data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data
analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about the data by
performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making
predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be
performed on the data which are not possible with only the data
provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated.
Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes?
As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on
daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or
snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?

\textbf{Question 7}: Putting the bike share data aside, think of a topic
or field of interest where you would like to be able to apply the
techniques of data science. What would you like to be able to learn from
your chosen subject?

\textbf{Answer}: I would love to analyse the customer behaviour patterns
and in forecasting the sales of diffrent product and services for the
company. Also for analysing the unstructured data.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip}: If we want to share the results of our analysis with
others, we aren't limited to giving them a copy of the jupyter Notebook
(.ipynb) file. We can also export the Notebook output in a form that can
be opened even for those without Python installed. From the
\textbf{File} menu in the upper left, go to the \textbf{Download as}
submenu. You can then choose a different format that can be viewed more
generally, such as HTML (.html) or PDF (.pdf). You may need additional
packages or software to perform these exports.
